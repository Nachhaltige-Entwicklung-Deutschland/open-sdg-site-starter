<h3 class="h3bold">1. How often are the data updated?</h3>
The frequency and timing of new data releases vary across indicators. As soon as new data for an
indicator become available or previously published data are revised, they are updated on the online
platform. As a rule, the platform is updated once per month. The date of the last update can be found
on the website next to the button for downloading the data.

<h3 class="h3bold">2. How can I suggest new or alternative data sources?</h3>
For feedback on the data sources used or to propose new data sources, please contact us

<h3 class="h3bold">3. What do the weather symbols mean?</h3>
For all indicators of the GSDS, specific targets are defined, which are to be achieved either annually
or by a specified future date. The weather symbols provide an indication of how an indicator is
developing in relation to its respective target. A detailed description of the assessment methodology
and the meaning of each weather symbol can be found
<a href="https://dns-indicators.de/status/">here</a>.

<h3 class="h3bold">4. Why is a weather symbol not available for every indicator?</h3>
The assessment of indicators in relation to their target achievement takes into account not only a
snapshot but also the development over past years. However, for some indicators, there are not enough
data points available, so no assessment can be made in these cases.
<br><br>
For other indicators, the comparability of the data over time is limited – for example, due to
methodological changes in data collection – so that a reliable statement on target achievement
cannot be provided.

<h3 class="h3bold">5. Why do the texts and weather symbols for some indicators not refer to the most recent reporting year?</h3>
The reporting by the Federal Statistical Office on the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy provides for the
publication of a comprehensive indicator report every two years. Since 2020, the indicator data have also been made available on this platform.
<br><br>
While the data on the platform are continuously updated, the texts and weather symbols cannot be adjusted continuously, as they are developed
in close coordination between the Federal Statistical Office and the responsible ministries. They therefore correspond to the status of the
last indicator report and may reflect an older status compared to the data.

<h3 class="h3bold">6. What does disaggregation mean?</h3>
Disaggregation refers to the division of an existing indicator into additional subcategories to enable a more detailed analysis. The most
common examples are age or sex. However, many indicators have specific disaggregations criteria.

<h3 class="h3bold">7. Can other countries copy this website?</h3>
The website can be freely used to create a national online platform. GitHub's terms of use apply. For more information,
