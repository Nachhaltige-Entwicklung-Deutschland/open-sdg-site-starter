(GSDS) and the set of indicators for Germany relating to the global
<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the UN', 'En');">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>
of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. The German Sustainable Development Strategy implements Agenda 2030 at the national level. Accordingly, related indicators from both strategies are cross-linked on the platform.
A direct link to the homepage of the SDG online platform can be found under <i>Start</i>.
<br><br>
The GSDS online platform is structured into 17 goals, 47 postulates, and the corresponding 82 indicators.

<h3 class="h3bold">Presentation of individual indicators</h3>
For each indicator, the relevant data are presented in both a chart and a table. For some indicators, this presentation is complemented by
an interactive map showing data for the German federal states (Länder).
Using the green buttons located below the chart, the data can be downloaded in CSV format, and the chart can be saved as a PNG file.

<h3 class="h3bold">Details, Content and progress, and Data sources</h3>
The tabs <i>Details</i>, <i>Content and progress</i>, and <i>Data sources</i> are located at the bottom of each indicator page.<ul>
<li>The Details tab contains a precise definition of the indicator, the intention for its inclusion in the GSDS, as well as information on the politically defined target and its achievement.</li>
<li>The Content and progress tab provides a detailed description of the indicator. It explains what the indicator measures and the conclusions that can be drawn from its values and their changes.
In addition, the indicator’s development over time is described and placed in a statistical context.</li>
<li>The Data sources tab provides links to the organisations that supplied the data for the time series, as well as, where possible, direct links to the corresponding data sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3bold">Comparison of Germany's indicators from the national and global indicator sets</h3>
There are numerous content overlaps between the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS)
and those of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
<br><br>
Some SDG indicators are similar or identical to the indicators of the GSDS. Both sets are organised according to the 17 goals of the UN Agenda 2030.
However, differences exist in the numbering and designation of the indicators. Where a GSDS indicator is comparable to an SDG indicator,
this is indicated by a button providing a direct link to the respective indicator.
