The online platform is structured into the indicator set of the
<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975274/1941044/2e8480a6b93910b347e647814ff59a7f/2021-07-09-kurzpapier-n-englisch-data.pdf?download=1" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the Federal Government', 'En');">German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS)</a>
and the indicator set for Germany on the global
<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the UN', 'En');">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>
of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The German Sustainable Development Strategy is the national implementation of the 2030 Agenda,
which is why related indicators from both strategies are linked to each other on the platform. You can find a direct link to the
homepage of the SDG online platform under "Start".
<br><br>
The DNS online platform is divided into 17 goals, 50 postulates and the corresponding indicators (83).

<h3 class="h3bold">Presentation of the indicators</h3>
The relevant data for each indicator is presented in a chart and a table. This presentation is supplemented for some indicators by
an interactive map showing the data for the German federal states.<br>The green buttons underneath the chart can be used to download the data in
CSV format or the chart as a PNG file.

<h3 class="h3bold">Details, Content and progress and data sources</h3>
The "Details", "Content and progress" and "Data sources" tabs can be found at the bottom of the indicator pages.<br><br>
The Details tab contains a precise definition of the indicator, the intention that led to the inclusion of the indicator
in the DNS and details of the politically defined target and its achievement.<br><br>
The "Content and progress" tab contains a detailed description of the indicator, which is based on the latest published indicator report
(see PDF file under "Strategy &rarr; Links &rarr; German Sustainable Development Strategy").
It describes what the indicator shows and what conclusions can be drawn from its values and their changes. In addition, the
development of the indicator over time is described and placed in a statistical context.<br><br>
Under "Data sources" you will find links to the organisation or organisations that provided the data for the time
series and - where possible - links directly to the specific data sources.

<h3 class="h3bold">Comparison of DNS and SDG indicators</h3>
There are numerous thematic overlaps between the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy and the indicators of the
UN Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>Some of the SDG indicators are similar or congruent with the indicators of the German
Sustainable Development Strategy. Both sets of indicators are structured according to the 17 goals of the UN 2030 Agenda. However,
there are differences in the numbering and labelling of the indicators. If a DNS indicator is comparable with an SDG indicator, this
is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator.
