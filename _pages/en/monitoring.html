The monitoring of the national sustainability indicators, as well as the reporting on their
findings and developments, is the responsibility of the Federal Statistical Office.
To this purpose, the Federal Statistical Office publishes
<a href="https://dns-indicators.de/strategy/publications/">indicator reports</a> and has operated an
<a href="https://dns-indicators.de/">online platform</a> under its own technical
responsibility since February 2020.
<br><br>
While the online platform is continuously updated to reflect the latest developments of the indicators,
the Federal Statistical Office reviews the indicators every two years in indicator reports to assess the
status of target achievement. This includes a trend analysis and an assessment of whether the targets
are likely to be achieved based on the current state of development. In this way, the Federal
Statistical Office provides information on the status of sustainable development in Germany between
the Federal Government's progress reports, which are published every four years.
<br><br>
Although the targets and associated indicators of the GSDS are politically determined, their
presentation in the indicator reports follows the statistical principles of professional independence,
objectivity, and neutrality. Professional independence is also important to the Federal Government
and is guaranteed through the cabinet decision on the GSDS 2016 of 11 January 2017.
