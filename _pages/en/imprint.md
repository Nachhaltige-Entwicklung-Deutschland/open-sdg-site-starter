Neither is such external information provided by the Federal Statistical Office, nor is the Federal Statistical Office in a position to exert influence on the information offered on third-party pages.

## Data protection

<b>The Federal Statistical Office is committed to protecting your privacy and complies with the data protection provisions. Your trust is important to us!</b>

With these notes, we meet our information obligations regarding the collection of personal data, as laid down in Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The Federal Statistical Office does not collect any personal data when the SDG online platform is accessed. However, you are also using the services of the provider GitHub. The GitHub privacy statement is here: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement).

Technical information from website visitors is recorded, including the IP address: this can be a personal date. Personal data are collected when you create an account.

The privacy statement at [https://www.destatis.de/DE/Service/Datenschutz/_inhalt.html](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Service/Datenschutz/_inhalt.html) applies to the use of social media and the general website content of the Federal Statistical Office.

As we continue to develop our website, we may have to revise the privacy statement. We therefore recommend that you read the statement regularly.

## Personal data

Personal data are information about you as an individual, such as your name, address, postal address or user behaviour, if the latter is not anonymised. This excludes information that does not identify you.

We collect your data when you give them to us, e.g. in an e-mail. In that case, the processing of your data is based on your consent.

## Use of cookies

We use cookies on this website. They are technically necessary for the full use of all the features of this website. Applying the cookies is based on Article 6 (1) point (e) of GDPR in conjunction with Section 3 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).

## Social media

The Federal Statistical Office uses the Twitter messaging service.

Its functions are offered by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. If you use Twitter and the re-tweet function, the websites you visit will be linked with your Twitter account and revealed to other users. Data will also be passed on to Twitter. Please note that we, the provider of the website content, do not know the data which are passed on or how Twitter uses them. For more information on the subject please refer to Twitter's privacy policy at [https://twitter.com/privacy](https://twitter.com/privacy).

You can change the Twitter privacy settings for your account at [https://twitter.com/account/settings](https://twitter.com/account/settings).

To plan what information should be released and then post it in the social networks, not to miss any relevant posts and to interact with users, the Federal Statistical Office uses the product "social hub" of the provider maloon GmbH; Schütterlettenweg 4; D-85053 Ingolstadt; Germany; phone: +49 (0)841 493 990-0; fax: +49 (0)841 493 990-10; e-mail: hallo@socialhub.io; web: [www.socialhub.io](http://www.socialhub.io/).

We do this to perform our public tasks as per Article 6 (1) point (e) of GDPR in conjunction with Section 3 of BDSG. If an enquiry is chargeable you will be notified by e-mail. This e-mail will not be sent if in particular cases your request already includes a specific order with the necessary parts of the contract. Processing is then based on Article 6 (1) point (b) of GDPR. You are also entitled to the relevant rights listed below.

## Protection of minors

## Contact

E-mail communication may involve security gaps. For example, E-mails may be delayed, read and even manipulated by skilled internet users before they reach the relevant staff members of the Federal Statistical Office. Therefore, only informal contacts are possible via e-mail. Legally binding statements currently cannot be made in this way. Should we receive an e-mail from you, we assume that we are authorised to reply by e-mail. Should this not be the case, we would ask you to explicitly choose a different medium for communication.

## General copyright

The following applies to all standard publications of the Federal Statistical Office, either in printed or electronic form, and for the content of this website, including charts and downloadable products, unless additional or other information is given on the product/web page itself.

© Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis), 2021 <br>
Reproduction and distribution, also of parts, are permitted provided that the source is mentioned.

This applies to any redistribution of texts, data and charts by third parties where the Federal Statistical Office is the copyright owner and holds exclusive publishing rights. Re-use is permitted both for commercial and non-commercial purposes. There are also no restrictions on distribution by electronic means, via the internet or in printed form. No express authorisation is required from the Federal Statistical Office. It is, however, required to provide a source note. Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis) shall be named as the publisher in the list of references.

Amendments, deletions/abridgements or omissions, redesigns or other modifications shall be identified as such, or a note shall be included in the references stating that the data have been changed, have only been used as the basis for calculation or have been presented in a different form.

Excluded from the temporally and geographically unlimited scope of use are the usage rights of third parties which are explicitly set out in our publications or on our web pages (e.g. photo rights). This also applies to jointly-issued products. There is no general policy here. Each product must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

It is therefore recommended that, when exploiting our data, users ensure that the copyright information is included in the product in question and, if necessary, that they contact the copyright owners given in the Legal Notice.
