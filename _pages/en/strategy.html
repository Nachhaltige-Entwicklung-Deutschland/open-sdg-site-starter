Each of the 178 signatory states pledged to implement Agenda 2021 nationally across all policy areas, involving both society and the economy.

the strategy has been aligned with Agenda 2030 and is referred to as the German Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS). It represents the
national implementation of Agenda 2030. At the same time, the Federal Government sets its own political priorities within the framework of the
global goals in the GSDS. These priorities are specified in sustainability postulates beneath the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, with national
indicators defined for measurement and specific target values and target years established.

The central steering body for the strategy is the State Secretaries' Committee for Sustainable Development.
