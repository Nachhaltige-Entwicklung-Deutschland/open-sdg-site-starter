<h3 class="h3bold">Open source project on GitHub</h3>
The online platforms are publicly accessible tools for providing and presenting data on national and global sustainability indicators.
They have been developed in accordance with recognised international standards, particularly with regard to open-access data and open source software.

<h3 class="h3bold">Sources</h3>
The Federal Statistical Office actively supports the development of national online platforms, particularly as an open source
solution for presenting sustainability indicators. The United States and the United Kingdom are pioneers in this field.
The project code for both the national and global platforms is publicly available in the following GitHub repositories:

</ul>
A universal version of the code for an online platform, developed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Center
for Open Data Enterprise, is available online. The German online platforms for national and global sustainability indicators
are based on this code. We recommend familiarising yourself with the platforms of the United States and the United Kingdom,
as well as with the corresponding
