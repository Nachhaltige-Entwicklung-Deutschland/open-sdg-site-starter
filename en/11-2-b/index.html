          <p> <p><b style="color: #fd9d24; font-size: large">11.2.b Final energy consumption in passenger transport</b><br /><br />This indicator represents the final energy consumption (FEC) resulting from the transport of people within Germany. The underlying data comes from the TREMOD database (Transport Emission Model) developed by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (ifeu). TREMOD is a model for assessing transport-related emissions. It captures fuel consumption in domestic passenger transport in Germany&nbsp;â&nbsp;regardless of the refuelling location&nbsp;â&nbsp;based on the consumption concept. The term <i>final energy</i> refers to the amount of energy directly used in transport. It does not account for transformation losses during fuel production or possible transmission losses. In air transport, only domestic flights are included; international flights to and from Germany are excluded. Passenger transport by ship is also not included.<br /><br />In 2023, 30.8% of total FEC was attributable to the transport sector, with passenger transport accounting for 61.5%<sup>1</sup>. Energy savings in this area therefore have a significant impact on Germanyâs overall energy consumption. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2019, FEC in passenger transport initially rose by 1.9% compared to the base year 2015, reaching a peak. With the onset of the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic in 2020, the indicator value dropped sharply due to the populationâs severely restricted mobility&nbsp;â&nbsp;by 16.2&nbsp;percentage points. In the following years, values increased only slowly. Over the full period from 2015&nbsp;to 2023, FEC in passenger transport declined by a total of 12.2%. If the recent trend continues, the politically defined target of a 15% to 20% reduction between 2015&nbsp;and 2030&nbsp;will be achieved.<br /><br />The so-called passenger transport performance indicates the total number of person-kilometres travelled. It serves as the basis for calculating the specific energy consumption in passenger transport and also originates from the TREMOD database. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2023, transport performance declined by 9.9%. In addition to the indicator, FEC per person-kilometre is used as a measure of energy efficiency in passenger transport. In 2023, this value&nbsp;â&nbsp;across all modes of transport&nbsp;â&nbsp;stood at 1.52&nbsp;megajoules per person-kilometre<sup>2</sup>, representing a 2.5% decrease compared to 2015.<br /><br />Motorised individual transport (passenger cars and two-wheeled vehicles) accounted for by far the largest share of total passenger transport performance in 2022, at 81.9%. This category can be further broken down by trip purpose: in 2022, 36.5% of journeys were work-related (commuting and business travel), 31.0% were for leisure, and 17.6% for shopping. Trends in these trip purposes have varied since 2015: leisure travel showed the most pronounced decline (â19.9&nbsp;percentage points), followed by shopping trips (â7.9&nbsp;percentage points) and work-related trips (â3.1&nbsp;percentage points).<br /><br /><small><sup>1</sup> The combined shares of freight transport (indicator <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/11-2-a/">11.2.a</a>) and passenger transport (indicator 11.2.b) in total transport-related FEC do not add up to exactly 100%. This discrepancy arises from differing definitions: while energy consumption in freight and passenger transport is based on domestic consumption (source: TREMOD), total FEC in transport is based on domestic fuel sales (source: AG Energiebilanzen).<br /><sup>2</sup> For context: the calorific value of one litre of petrol is 32&nbsp;megajoules. A consumption of 1.52&nbsp;megajoules per person-kilometre is equivalent&nbsp;â&nbsp;extrapolated to 100&nbsp;kilometres&nbsp;â&nbsp;to the energy content of approximately 4.8&nbsp;litres of petrol.</small></p>
