          <p> <p><b style="color: #4c9f38; font-size: large">3.1.f Obesity rate among adults</b><br /><br />The Body Mass Index (BMI) serves as a reference value for assessing overweight and, in particular, obesity. It is calculated as the ratio of body weight to the square of body height (expressed in kg/mÂ²). Individual differences in body build, age- and sex-specific characteristics, as well as the composition of body mass, are not taken into account. According to the classification of the World Health Organization (WHO), individuals with a BMI of 25&nbsp;or above are considered overweight, and those with a BMI of 30&nbsp;or above are classified as obese.<br /><br />The data basis for this indicator consists of self-reported body weight and height, which are voluntarily collected every four years within the framework of the Mikrozensus, covering 1% of the total population. In self-reports&nbsp;â&nbsp;as collected in the Mikrozensus&nbsp;â&nbsp;body weight is often underestimated compared to measured values, while height tends to be overestimated. Therefore, it can be assumed that the BMI calculated from these data is generally lower than the value that would be determined based on measured data. To ensure comparability of data across different years and regions, and to avoid distortions due to differences in age structure, the results were age-standardised based on the new European Standard Population.<br /><br />In 2021, 15.4% of the population aged 18&nbsp;and over were classified as obese. The proportion of obese men was 17.3%, exceeding that of women, of whom 13.3% were affected. In 1999, the proportion was still 10.7%. Even then, women (10.2%) were slightly less affected by obesity than men (11.1%). Thus, the obesity rate among adults has increased and is developing contrary to the politically established targets of the Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie. A further 33.6% of the population aged 18&nbsp;and over had a BMI between 25&nbsp;and under 30&nbsp;in 2021. Overall, this meant that 49% of adults were classified as overweight (BMI â¥ 25). The proportion of overweight women was significantly lower at 38.7%, compared to 58.5% of men affected.<br /><br />The proportion of obese individuals increases with age and only decreases again at older ages. In 2021, 5.3% of women aged 20&nbsp;to under 25&nbsp;were obese. In the age group 30&nbsp;to under 35, the proportion was already 12.3%. The highest value for women was recorded in the age group 70&nbsp;to under 75, at 20.1%. Among men, the obesity rate was higher than that of women of the same age group in all age groups under 75. The highest rates were recorded in the 45&nbsp;to under 50&nbsp;and 60&nbsp;to under 65&nbsp;age groups, both at 23.5%. In the age group 75&nbsp;and above, women (16.3%) and men (16.1%) were obese at nearly equal rates.</p>
