How often are the data updated?\nThe frequency and timing of new data releases vary across indicators. As soon as new data for an\nindicator become available or previously published data are revised, they are updated on the online\nplatform. As a rule, the platform is updated once per month. The date of the last update can be found\non the website next to the button for downloading the data.\n\n2. How can I suggest new or alternative data sources?\nFor feedback on the data sources used or to propose new data sources, please contact us\nat: dns-indikatoren@destatis.de\n\n3. What do the weather symbols mean?\nFor all indicators of the GSDS, specific targets are defined, which are to be achieved either annually\nor by a specified future date. The weather symbols provide an indication of how an indicator is\ndeveloping in relation to its respective target. A detailed description of the assessment methodology\nand the meaning of each weather symbol can be found\nhere.\n\n4. Why is a weather symbol not available for every indicator?\nThe assessment of indicators in relation to their target achievement takes into account not only a\nsnapshot but also the development over past years. However, for some indicators, there are not enough\ndata points available, so no assessment can be made in these cases.\n\nFor other indicators, the comparability of the data over time is limited â for example, due to\nmethodological changes in data collection â so that a reliable statement on target achievement\ncannot be provided.\n\n5. Why do the texts and weather symbols for some indicators not refer to the most recent reporting year?\nThe reporting by the Federal Statistical Office on the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy provides for the\npublication of a comprehensive indicator report every two years. Since 2020, the indicator data have also been made available on this platform.\n\nWhile the data on the platform are continuously updated, the texts and weather symbols cannot be adjusted continuously, as they are developed\nin close coordination between the Federal Statistical Office and the responsible ministries. They therefore correspond to the status of the\nlast indicator report and may reflect an older status compared to the data.\n\n6. What does disaggregation mean?\nDisaggregation refers to the division of an existing indicator into additional subcategories to enable a more detailed analysis. The most\ncommon examples are age or sex. However, many indicators have specific disaggregations criteria.\n\n7. Can other countries copy this website?\nThe website can be freely used to create a national online platform. GitHubâs terms of use apply. For more information,\nsee Technical notes.\n","id":""},"/open-sdg-site-starter/en/en/help/guidance/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/open-sdg-site-starter/en/en/help/guidance/","title":"Technical notes\n","content":"Open source project on GitHub\nThe online platforms are publicly accessible tools for providing and presenting data on national and global sustainability indicators.\nThey have been developed in accordance with recognised international standards, particularly with regard to open-access data and open source software.\n\nSources\nThe Federal Statistical Office actively supports the development of national online platforms, particularly as an open source\nsolution for presenting sustainability indicators.

The Indicator Report entitled \"Statusindikatoren einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\"\n          (Status indicators of sustainable development in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg) has been published since 2014. The fourth (2022) edition of the\n          report\n          was for the first time prepared only in interactive online format. It was issued by the Sustainable Development Strategy Office of the\n          Ministry for the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. 52 status indicators give on overview of\n          sustainable development by providing data, background information and evaluations. 6 indicators offers insights into the personal attitudes\n          and feelings of the people in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. To improve the comparability of indicators at federal and Land levels, this set of indicators\n          was harmonised as far as possible with the nationwide set employed in the German Sustainability Strategy and the indicators used by the\n          Working Party for Sustainable Development\n          of the statistical offices of the LÃ¤nder. The\n          Land Statistical Office\n          Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg was involved in compiling the Indicator Reports. The responsibility lies with the\n          State Institute for the Environment\n          of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.\n          \n      \n      Bayern\n      \n        The current version of the Bavarian\n          Sustainable Development Strategy\n          was adopted by the Bavarian Council of Ministers in March 2022. It is the result of intensive collaboration between all Land ministries and\n          the State Chancellery. In its Sustainable Development Strategy, the Land government specifies the goals it sets itself and describes the\n          measures it is taking to achieve them.\n          With the Indicator Report\n          \"Sustainable Development in Bavaria\", the Bavarian State Statistical Office takes over the statistical reporting\n          on the progress made by the Free State of Bavaria in this area. The second edition of the\n          report\n          was published in December 2023 with an update of all indicators. The Bavarian State Office for the Environment also\n          publishes environmental indicators for Bavaria.\n        \n      \n      Berlin\n      \n        Assessing sustainable development in Berlin is based on a set of indicators consisting of 40 \"core indicators\", each of which is assigned to\n          one of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals. The\n          Core Indicator Report\n          on sustainable development in Berlin was last updated in 2021 by the Senate Department for the Environment, Mobility, Consumer and Climate\n          Protection in cooperation with the Statistical Office of Berlin-Brandenburg. A sustainability strategy for all of Berlin is currently being\n          developed on which the leaflet\n          \"Die 17 Nachhaltigkeitsziele in Berlin\"\n          (The 17 Sustainable Development Goals in Berlin) is based.\n      \n      Brandenburg\n      \n        In 2010 the Land govenment of Brandenburg decided to develop a strategy for the sustainable development of Brandenburg. As a result of various\n          phases of dialogue, Brandenburg's\n          Sustainable Development Strategy\n          was adopted in April 2014 and updated in 2019. A first report including 49\n          sustainable development indicators\n          for Brandenburg was submitted in July 2017. Taking stock of potential sustainable development indicators, it is intended as a basis for discussing\n          ways of implementing and updating the Sustainable Development Stategy of Brandenburg. The report was prepared by the Statistical Office of\n          Berlin-Brandenburg on behalf of the Ministry for Rural Development, the Environment and Agriculture of the Land of Brandenburg.\n        \n      \n      Bremen\n      \n        Every two years since 2021, Bemen has prepared a report on how the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is progressing.\n          The report and the goals that will be derived from it replace the strategy for sustainable development. The State Chancellery of Bremen is\n          responsible for the coordination. The objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are monitored decentrally\n          in the individual ministries of Bremen. The Sustainability Report 2023 was approved by the Bremen Senate on 23 April 2024.The\n          Sustainable Development Goals report of Bremen\n          covers indicators relating to the all 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and their targets.\n        \n      \n      Hamburg\n      \n        The government of Hamburg adopted a document on the\n          \"Umsetzung der Nachhaltigkeitsziele der Vereinten Nationen in Hamburg\"\n          (Implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in Hamburg) in July 2017. In addition to identifying the aspects of the government's\n          policy which are already in line with the goals of the 2030 Agenda, the document points out the topics which have to be worked on in the next few years.\n          Plans have been made to develop a two-yearly reporting system together with the Statistical Office of North of Germany. The responsibility lies with the\n          Ministry for the Environment, Climate, Energy and Agricultural Industry.\n        \n      \n      Hessen\n      \n        In 2008 the Land government of Hessen launched the\n          \"Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie Hessen\"\n          (Sustainable Development Strategy for Hessen). Its goals and indicators were developed in a participative process. The indicators were revised fundamentally\n          with a view to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in 2015 and new target values were defined for 2030 as part of a\n          refinement process in the years 2017 and 2018. The goals and indicators were assigned to the fields of \"economy\", \"ecology\" and \"social affairs\" in the biennial\n          Progress Report\n          published between 2010 and 2016; the Progress Reports issued in 2020 and 2022 with 13 target indicators and 42 reporting indicators are structured according\n          to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda.A\n          supplementary edition\n          of the progress report 2022 in 2023 focussed on the 17 new indicators.\n          An integrated presentation of the 17 new and 55 old indicators is planned for the 2024 progress report.\n        \n      \n      Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n      \n        To date there has been no Sustainable Development Strategy for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As set out in the 2016-2021 coalition agreement, a strategy for the\n          sustainable development of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is to be developed in line with the National Sustainable Development Strategy.\n        \n      \n      Niedersachsen\n      \n        In May 2017 the Land government adopted Niedersachsen's new indicator-based\n          Sustainable Development Strategy.\n          In September 2020, the first Progress Report on the \"NiedersÃ¤chsische Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie\" (Sustainable Development Strategy of Niedersachsen)\n          commissioned by the Land government was prepared by the Land Statistical Office of Niedersachsen. It focuses on adjusting and updating the sustainable\n          development indicators and, in particular, on an even stronger and more systematic integration of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations\n          into Niedersachsen's indicator set. The structure of the Progress Report follows the Sustainable Development Strategy and the selection of indicators is\n          based on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals in terms of content.\n        \n      \n      Nordrhein-Westfalen\n      \n        The Land government adopted the first\n          Sustainable Development Strategy\n          for Nordrhein-Westfalen in 2016, which was updated in 2020. On behalf of the Land government of Nordrhein-Westfalen, the statistics sector of IT.NRW\n          (Central statistical and IT service provider of Nordrhein-Westfalen) prepared the first\n          Sustainable Development Report\n          in 2016 and updated it in 2020. It comprises nearly 70 indicators. Current data regarding the sustainable development indicators are provided online on an\n          Internet portal.\n        \n      \n      Rheinland-Pfalz\n      \n        A Sustainable Development Strategy\n          for Rheinland-Pfalz has been in place since 2001. In the beginning, the strategy was revised every two years. A first indicator-based report was published in 2005.\n          Since 2009, the Sustainable Development Strategy has been revised every four years. However, the data or\n          Indicator Report\n          (latest report with 27 indicators 2023) is still published every other year. The Land Statistical Office of Rheinland-Pfalz has been\n          responsible for preparing the Indicator Report since 2011.\n        \n      \n      Saarland\n      \n        The Sustainable Development Strategy\n          for the Saarland entitled \"Gemeinsam Verantwortung tragen fÃ¼r heute und morgen\" (Sharing responsibility for today and\n          tomorrow) was adopted in December 2016 after a two-year preparation phase based on a dialogue within society at eye level. With its six areas of action and\n          39 indicators, the Sustainable development Strategy focuses on central sustainabillity topics which are relevant for the Saarland from its perspective as a\n          federal state but also in the global context. The Saarland was one of the first LÃ¤nder to show in its strategy which of the global sustainability goals adopted\n          under the 2030 Agenda are particularly relevant for the Land and what aspects require more attention.\n          \n          From 2020 to 2022, the Sustainable Development Strategy was\n          updated\n          under the aegis of the\n          Ministry\n          for the Environment, Climate, Mobility, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. The updating process was open for participation and focused on the ideas and\n          project approaches for implementing the Sustainable Development Strategy. Under the motto \"Wir gestalten gemeinsam. Saarland nachhaltig\" (Jointly shaping a\n          sustainable Saarland), all interested an committed citizens and stakeholders in society were invited to network and get into dialogue and thus play an active\n          part in the updating process. In this context, a team of sustainability experts selected ten flagship projects for a more sustainable Saarland from 80 proposals\n          submitted and the process of successful implementation was started jointly. The continuous development of sustainability is both the basis and the mission of Saarland's\n          Sustainability Policy - to be pursued together with citizens.\n        \n      \n      Sachsen\n      \n        The\n          Sustainable Development Strategy\n          describes major topics, central goals and challenges regarding the sustainable development of Sachsen. When the Sustainable Development Strategy was prepared in\n          2018, Sachsen's areas of action were linked with the Sustainable Developments Goals of the 2030 Agenda. These areas of action are addressed in the Sustainable Development\n          Report and sets of indicators, among others, are used for measurement purposes. The 2022\n          Sustainable Development Report\n          for Sachsen has been available since the end of 2022. Such reports are prepared once per legislative term.\n        \n      \n      Sachsen-Anhalt\n      \n        Under the aegis of the Ministry for Science, energy, Climate Protection and the Environment and in cooperation with other ministries involved, a new version of\n          the Sustainable Development Strategy was prepared for Sachsen-Anhalt in 2022. The strategy is based on the 17 Sustainable development Goals of the united\n          Nations' 2030 Agenda and presents the current situation, the framework conditions in Sachsen-Anhalt, the goals to be implemented and the relevant measures\n          that have to be taken to achieve these goals by 2030. The strategy includes an updated Indicator Report, which describes Sachsen-Anhalt's sustainability\n          goals and adapts goals for past periods to the 2030 perspective.\n          \n          Education is the central element of the Sustainable Development Strategy. It is regarded as on of the key factors of sustainable living in Sachsen-Anhalt. By assigning an individual target to promote the development of creative competencies for shaping the future, participation and critical thinking, an important contribution is made to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda. The Sustainable Development Strategy and more information on sustainable development in Sachsen-Anhalt are available\n          here.\n        \n      \n      Schleswig-Holstein\n      \n        In December 2018, the Land government of Schleswig-Holstein identified a total of 75 indicators as a basis for taking stock of the sustainable development\n          in Schleswig-Holstein and for measuring its sustainable development until 2030: 44 target indicators, 27 reporting indicators and 4 reference indicators.\n          Schleswig-Holstein's first report on the UN Sustainable Development Goals was published on this basis in June 2020. A PDF of the report is provided\n          here.\n          The report will be updated every five years. A webpage offering key information can be accessed\n          here.\n        \n      \n      ThÃ¼ringen\n      \n        The Land government adopted a Sustainable Development Strategy including relevant indicators for ThÃ¼ringen in 2011. The first Indicator Report with 27\n          indicators was published in 2012.\n          \n          When the 2030 Agenda was adopted, ThÃ¼ringen's Sustainable Development Strategy had to be adjusted. The\n          strategy\n          with five areas of focus and reference to the Sustainable Development Goals was adopted in 2018. Each ministry prepared its own\n          Sustainable Development Plan\n          in 2018, too, which supports sustainable action in the respective policy area.

It explains what the indicator measures and the conclusions that can be drawn from its values and their changes.\nIn addition, the indicatorâs development over time is described and placed in a statistical context.\nThe Data sources tab provides links to the organisations that supplied the data for the time series, as well as, where possible, direct links to the corresponding data sources.\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nComparison of Germany's indicators from the national and global indicator sets\nThere are numerous content overlaps between the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS)\nand those of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nSome SDG indicators are similar or identical to the indicators of the GSDS. Both sets are organised according to the 17 goals of the UN Agenda 2030.\nHowever, differences exist in the numbering and designation of the indicators.

This labelling does not represent a political assessment or a forecast. Rather, the symbols offer an initial assessment of developments and are not a substitute for the explanatory texts, further analyses, or background information. The assignment of symbols to indicators is based on the formulation of the respective target:\n\nIndicators with absolute or relative target values\n\nIn most cases, an indicator is expected to achieve a specific absolute or relative target value in a designated target year (for example, indicator 3.1.a). For such a target formulation, the average of the last five annual changes is first calculated based on the most recent six data points. This average serves as an assumption for the projected annual development up to the target year. On this basis, a hypothetical target value is derived and compared with the politically defined target value of the indicator. The difference between these two values determines the assignment of one of the following symbols:\n\n Â  If the trend continues, the target value would be reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the current value (on-track indicator).\n\n Â \tIf the trend continues, the target is expected to be missed by at least 5% but no more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value (on-track indicator).\n\n Â  The indicator is developing in the desired direction. However, if this trend continues, the target is expected to be missed by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value in the target year (off-track indicator).\n\n Â  The distance to the target remains consistently large or even increases. The indicator is therefore not developing in the desired direction (off-track indicator).\n\nIn exceptional cases, the calculation of the average change described above may be based on four or five data points. If fewer than four usable annual values are available, no calculation is performed.\n\nIndicators with target intervals\n\nIf no specific target value is specified, but rather a target interval (for example, indicator 11.1.a), the minimum requirement of this target interval is used as the basis for calculating the status. If an indicator has several target values with different target years (for example, indicator 7.2.a), the target year closest to the future is used for the status calculation.\n\nIndicators with a constant annual target\n\nIf a target or threshold value is not to be achieved in the future but must be maintained each year (for example, indicator 6.2.a, b), two pieces of information are used for the assessment: primarily the most recent value achieved, and secondarily, the average of the last five changes:\n\nIf the target value or a better value was achieved last year and the average change does not indicate a deterioration, a sun is shown.\nIf the target value or a better value was achieved last year, but the average change indicates a deterioration, the sun remains but is slightly obscured by a cloud.\nIf the target value was not achieved, but the average development is moving in the desired direction, only a cloud is shown.\nIf the target value was not achieved and the average development is not moving towards the target, the thunderstorm symbol is shown.\n\n\nThis procedure is also applied when an indicator is supposed to reach a specific target value for a specified target year but has already reached it beforehand, or when the target year coincides with the last reporting year. In these cases, the standard procedure does not provide a reliable indication of the development.\n\nIndicators with target direction but no specific target value\n\nIf only a desired target direction but no specific target value, is specified for an indicator (for example, indicator 15.3.a), two pieces of information are used for the assessment: primarily the average of the last five changes and, secondarily, the most recent annual change:\n\nIf both the average value and the latest annual change point in the desired direction, a sun is shown.\nIf the average development points in the desired direction, but the latest annual change shows a contrary development or stagnation, the sun is slightly obscured by a cloud.\nIf the average value indicates the wrong direction or stagnation, but the latest annual change indicates a turnaround in the desired direction, a cloud is shown.\nIf neither the average value nor the latest annual change indicates the desired direction, a thunderstorm is shown.\n\n\nIndicators with several target values\n\nIf several targets are defined for an indicator that must be achieved simultaneously (for example, indicator 10.1), the development towards each individual target is assessed separately. The weather symbol for the indicator is then based on the most negative individual assessment.\n\nAssessments over time\n\nThe overview table shows the assessments of the indicators from previous years, indicating whether the weather symbol for an indicator has been stable or rather volatile in the past.\n","id":""},"/open-sdg-site-starter/en/en/status_summary/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/open-sdg-site-starter/en/en/status_summary/","title":"Indicator status - Overview\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/open-sdg-site-starter/en/en/strategy/dns/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/open-sdg-site-starter/en/en/strategy/dns/","title":"German Sustainable Development Strategy\n","content":"In 1992, the United Nations committed to the principle of sustainable development at the Rio de Janeiro conference and adopted a global action programme:\nAgenda 2021.\nEach of the 178 signatory states pledged to implement Agenda 2021 nationally across all policy areas, involving both society and the economy.\nGermany also signed the Agenda and, in 2002, adopted its first National Sustainability Strategy, which has since been further developed every four years.\n\nSince its\nrevision in 2016,\nthe strategy has been aligned with Agenda 2030 and is referred to as the German Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS).
