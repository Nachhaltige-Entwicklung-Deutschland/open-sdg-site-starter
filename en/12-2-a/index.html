          <p> <p><b style="color: #bf8b2e; font-size: large">12.2.a Eco-management and Audit Scheme (<abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr>)</b><br /><br /><b>Background</b><br /><br />The environmental management system <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) is a voluntary instrument of the European Union (<abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>) that supports organisations of all sizes and sectors in systematically enhancing their environmental performance. Holding an <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> registration does not necessarily imply that the organisation or its products are fundamentally more environmentally friendly or sustainable than comparable organisations or products.<br /><br />For initial registration or renewal of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> certification, organisations are required to produce a publicly accessible environmental statement. This statement contains essential information on the organisationâs environmental impacts, including data on energy consumption, emissions, material input, water usage, waste generation, and land use with regard to biodiversity. Since 2010, large enterprises have been obliged to update their environmental statement annually. Small and medium-sized enterprises (<abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises" tabindex="0">SMEs</abbr>) may do so every two years upon application.<br /><br />The environmental statement and other internal documents are subject to regular verification&nbsp;â&nbsp;at least once every three years&nbsp;â&nbsp;by independent, state-accredited environmental verifiers. Organisations that successfully complete these audits and have no violations of environmental law or registered complaints are included in the <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> register.<br /><br />The <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> register records both the number of registered organisations and their operational sites. Foreign sites of German <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> organisations are also listed in the register, but are not included in the scope of this indicator.<br /><br />Since 2017, companies from certain sectors have been allowed to extend <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> certification to multiple sites. This so-called multisite procedure was made cross-sectoral at the end of 2023. It enables organisations with numerous, structurally similar locations to have only a representative sample physically audited during initial validation and subsequent inspections.<br /><br />Organisations may choose to register their sites individually or through group registration in the <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> register&nbsp;â&nbsp;an aspect that has significantly influenced the development of the indicator.<br /><br />Although <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> is a European system, it also has international relevance. In addition to <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> Member States, countries such as Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein participate. Several multinational corporations&nbsp;â&nbsp;including BMW, Siemens, Coca-Cola HBC, and NestlÃ©&nbsp;â&nbsp;implement <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> even at locations outside the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>. These are listed in the <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> register but are not included in the number of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> sites reported here.<br /><br />In Germany, various funding programmes support companies in the implementation and maintenance of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr>. Moreover, <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr>-registered organisations benefit from simplified regulatory environmental inspections in several LÃ¤nder, as their regular reporting is recognised as evidence of exemplary environmental performance.<br /><br /><b>Development</b><br /><br />Between 2005&nbsp;and 2024, the number of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr>-registered sites in Germany increased from 1,958&nbsp;to 4,533&nbsp;â&nbsp;an increase of 132&nbsp;%. A decisive factor in this rise was the registration of 1,987&nbsp;Aldi SÃ¼d sites in October 2024, following the described adjustment of the multisite procedure. Compared to the previous year (2023), which recorded 2,455&nbsp;registered sites, this corresponds to nearly a doubling in site numbers (+84.6&nbsp;%).<br /><br />The politically defined target of increasing the number of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr>-registered sites to at least 5,000&nbsp;by 2030&nbsp;is likely to be achieved&nbsp;â&nbsp;provided that recent trends continue or that further large-scale group registrations occur. Although the number of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> sites had been rising steadily even before 2023, the potential to meet the 2030&nbsp;target is primarily attributable to the expansion of the multisite procedure.<br /><br />By contrast, the number of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr>-registered organisations&nbsp;â&nbsp;irrespective of the number of sites&nbsp;â&nbsp;has remained largely stable since 2020&nbsp;(1,122&nbsp;organisations in 2024), following a significant decline in previous years. Overall, this represents adecrease of 24.7&nbsp;% since 2005.<br /><br />At the same time, the number of employees in <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> organisations increased from 961,000&nbsp;in 2005&nbsp;to 1,258,000&nbsp;in 2024&nbsp;â&nbsp;an increase of 30.9&nbsp;%. Compared with the previous year alone (1,180,000&nbsp;employees), this represents a growth of 6.6&nbsp;% in 2024. The data clearly indicate that <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> is increasingly being adopted by larger organisations with multiple locations and high employment figures. The introduction of the multisite procedure and the associated reduction in auditing requirements have further strengthened this trend.<br /><br />Broken down by economic sector, 38.3&nbsp;% of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> sites were attributable to the manufacturing industry. Other notable sectors included education and training (6.5&nbsp;%), other services (6.4&nbsp;%), and water supply, sewerage, waste management, and remediation activities (6.2&nbsp;%). Some <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> organisations are assigned to more than one economic sector.<br /><br />From a regional perspective, in 2024&nbsp;the highest number of <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> sites was recorded in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (1,239), followed by Bayern (1,108) and Nordrhein-Westfalen (773). In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, only seven <abbr title="Eco-Management and Audit Scheme" tabindex="0">EMAS</abbr> sites were registered.</p>
